A Pythonic client for the official [data.gov.gr](https://data.gov.gr) API. Aims to be an easy, intuitive and 
out-of-the-box way to:

- find data published by central government, local authorities and public bodies of Greece
- build related products and services.

while being robust, following best-practices and eliminating developer-induced bugs.

The aspiration for this library is to enable users of different backgrounds (academia, industry, students etc.) with 
an interest to programmatically explore and utilize the open data of data.gov.gr, to do so without having to 
write-debug-maintain trivial code or worry about that.
